## Vision section
We will cover using object detection and segmentation algorithms to detect items in the robots vision area.

### YOLOV3
In the object detection file we use the YOLOv3 model which is trained on 80 classes of objects but is not usefull for our
specific use case. A potential approach may be to finetune the model.
